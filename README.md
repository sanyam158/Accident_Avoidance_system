# Accident_Avoidance_system

This is an Arduino-based collision detection warning system. This is one of the fastest growing safety feature in automobile industry.
This system enables vehicles to identify the chances of collision to give visual and audio warnings to driver based on the distance between the object and the obstacle.


This project idea is based on an Arduino controller. 
We have used Ultrasonic sensor to find the distance to collision.

According to the distance calculated , we can define 3 different zones

Zone 1: No warning
Zone 2: Only visual warning (LED is blinked to get the attention of the driver)
Zone 3: Both visual and audio warning (A buzzer also buzzes so that the driver get to know that their is an obstacle in front of the vehicle)
